# Venty Tests
All of the venty tests are located under the [source directory directly](/venty).

Each source code file SHOULD have a `_test.py` file attached to it.

For example:
* [in_memory_event_store.py](/venty/in_memory_event_store.py) 
* [in_memory_event_store_test.py](/venty/in_memory_event_store_test.py)
